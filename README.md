# General Info
The CS50 is a course that teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). 

Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.

The CS50 course recognizes that interactions with others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. There are many great communities for support and help, such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/">CS50 Subreddit</a> and <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0454A63D/C0454A65T">CS50 Slack</a>. Investing your time and energy into solving each and every problem set independently is the best way to experience the course.
