# World 1-1
Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks, a la the below.

Let’s recreate that pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself is also be taller than it is wide.

The program we’ll write will be called mario. And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

### Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 8 when prompted:
```
$ ./mario
Height: 8

       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```
### Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 4 when prompted:
```
$ ./mario
Height: 4

   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
### Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 2 when prompted:
```
$ ./mario
Height: 2

 #
##
```
### And here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 1 when prompted:
```
$ ./mario
Height: 1

#
```
If the user doesn’t, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate:
```
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4

   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
